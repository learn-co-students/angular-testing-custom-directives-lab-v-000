# Testing using Protractor/Jasmine/Karma

## Objectives

- Write an end-to-end(E2E) test for View functionality

## Instructions

Inside this repo, we have a user profile which is transcluded to have labels above the necessary fields. This time, our directive is functioning properly - it's your job to add the tests!

Write a protractor test to make sure that the correct content is put into the correct place. Your test should verify that name, position and description are all rendered above the correct elements.
